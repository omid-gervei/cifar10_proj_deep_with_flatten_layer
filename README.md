1. General info

This is a test project for classifying the welknown cifar10 database using a deep neural network. As we know the best structure for image classification using neural network is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). But we just want to check if we can use a sequential network for this classification. The results are not so promising but it was worth trying.   

2. Used methods

we used ***Grid search*** to find the best parameters of the most famous **Deep Learning** algorithms:

- Tensorflow

- Keras

- Sequential models



# Highlights



 ```python

model.compile(loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
              optimizer = "sgd",metrics=['accuracy'])

 ```
